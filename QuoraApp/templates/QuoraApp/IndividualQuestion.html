                        The ground reality is colleges differ in various aspects. Some are “tier 1” and some “tier 3”. Let’s take a look at some of the glaring differences between the students of these colleges :
                        Connections - This is the most obvious one. Students need better alumni to get more opportunities. In tier 1 colleges, this is something which is really stressed upon. Their alumni are at many great positions, and they come in handy whenever needed.
                        Health and wellness features availability - This is not so stressed upon in Indian context, but many colleges do not have sports fields and other facilities. These contribute to well balanced development of students.
                        Mentality - Many students develop a inferiority complex or a superiority complex depending on the college they are in. Both of them are equally toxic in the long run. But it gives you a certain level of confidence when you are from a tier 1 college.

                        I can Say as I had study in both tier 1 and tier 2/3 colleges.

                        Tier 1 - IIT/ NITs -
                        
                        Students get Everything with less fees than Private Business University with more Opportunities and Good background and competitive Environment.
                        They get facilities for growth of their Course.
                        Rigorous lab and more inclination toward practicals and projects.
                        High pressure and time management.
                        Free seminars and workshop every other week for students by best mentors.
                        Participation of Top product based companies.
                        Ratio of girls and boys is worst.
                        Tier 2/3 - Every Other private and State colleges -
                        
                        Irritating and useless Attendance policy 75% for giving exams.
                        Heavy fees !!
                        Student have to pay even for 1 test tube and wire and many kits in labs are not working or either not used for long time , If it work then faculties are not interested to put their whole effort on teaching practicals to students.
                        Due to College management work ethics even faculties and students are not interested towards their work.
                        Just copying and pasting useless assignment.
                        Exams every other months.
                        Writing Codes on pages and getting signed with Professor with closed eyes.
                        Copying codes from pen drive, Internet and books in lab and practicals exam.
                        Seminars and workshop and most of the things are paid.
